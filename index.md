# Super Mario Galaxy 2 Bingo

I couldn't have done it without your support.

## Features of SMG2 Bingo

### An all-new generator

A brand new generator featuring 125 goals has been specially constructed for use with this mod. Development is ongoing, but it has performed well and most have found it very enjoyable.

### Brand new World Map Layouts

The world maps have been altered to remove required galaxies, among various other features. They can be viewed below:

### Pre-Unlocked Character Switching

The character switching room will be unlocked as soon as you step on Starship Mario's panel for the first time, allowing you to play bingo as either Mario or Luigi.

### English Save Files

These save files have gotten Sky Station 1 and its Comet Medal, cutting down on gameplay that would be similar between every game.

### Lower Completion Requirements

The requirements for Comet Medals needed for each Comet, Star Barriers, and World Map Hungry Lumas have been lowered significantly to further streamline gameplay. Because of the latter change, Banktoad does not spawn.
