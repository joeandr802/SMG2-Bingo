Hello! Thanks for downloading this mod. 

To use it, you'll need Homebrew Launcher and Riivolution working on your Wii/Wii U, 
as well as an SD card and a copy of Super Mario Galaxy 2 on disc that
matches the region of your Wii/Wii U.

Once you have those things, follow these steps to install the mod.
1. Extract the zip folder you recieved into the root of your SD Card.
2. Put your SD card in your console and transfer the English Super Mario Galaxy 2 save 
   from your SD card to your Wii System Memory. 
WARNING: This will overwrite your current SMG2 save. Be sure to back it up somewhere.
3. Make sure your SD card and game disc are in your Wii when you launch Riivolution.
4. Make sure ONLY the SMG2 Bingo Mod is enabled, then launch the game.

A spreadsheet is included in your download. It details all gameplay changes made in
the mod. Referring to it during your Bingo game is allowed and encouraged. 
There is also a copy of the board generator, so you can start Bingo games on your own.

This mod uses a built-in crash debugger. If you encounter a crash, 
please send me your save file and pictures of the crash screen if you can.

I used to have a Luma in-game say this, but I removed it, so I'll repeat it here:

Thank you for playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 Bingo!
This is my first SMG2 mod, so if you find any bugs, please let me know.
I'd also like to thank everyone who was involved in the creation and testing of this mod.
I couldn't have done it without your support.
Sincerely, ice_cream_joe
